## üìã Commit Message Guidelines

### Format

```
<type>: <short summary>

<detailed description>

<footer with issue references>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `security`: Security fixes

### Examples

```
feat: Add support for custom DNS seeds

- Allow configuration of custom DNS seed nodes
- Update chainparams.cpp with seed management
- Add documentation for seed node setup

Closes #45
```

```
fix: Resolve port conflict on testnet startup

The testnet was using the same port as mainnet causing
conflicts when both networks were running simultaneously.

Changed testnet port from 8732 to 18732.

Fixes #67
```

## üé® Code Style Guidelines

### C++ Code

- Follow Bitcoin Core's coding style
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment non-obvious code

### Example

```cpp
// Good
int CalculateBlockReward(int height) {
    // Initial reward is 50 JER
    int64_t reward = 50 * COIN;

    // Halving occurs every 210,000 blocks
    int halvings = height / 210000;

    // Stop if we've gone through all halvings
    if (halvings >= 64) return 0;

    return reward >> halvings;
}

// Bad
int calc(int h) {
    int64_t r = 50 * COIN;
    return r >> (h / 210000);
}
```

### Shell Scripts

- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable names
- Check for errors (`set -e`)

### Markdown

- Use proper headers (# ## ###)
- Add blank lines between sections
- Use code blocks with language hints
- Keep lines reasonably short
