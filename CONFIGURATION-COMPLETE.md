## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Before Production Launch

### You MUST Address These

1. **Genesis Block Difficulty** ‚ùå CRITICAL
   - Current: Easy difficulty (0x207fffff)
   - Required: Proper difficulty for mainnet security
   - Impact: Network will be instantly exploitable without this
   - Cost: Days/weeks of GPU mining OR hire mining service

2. **Security Audit** ‚ùå CRITICAL
   - Current: None
   - Required: Professional security audit ($10K-100K)
   - Impact: Unknown vulnerabilities, potential hacks
   - Risk: Could lose everything if exploited

3. **Legal Review** ‚ùå CRITICAL
   - Current: None
   - Required: Cryptocurrency lawyer consultation ($5K-20K)
   - Impact: Regulatory compliance, securities law
   - Risk: Legal liability, fines, shutdowns

4. **Seed Nodes** ‚ùå REQUIRED
   - Current: None deployed
   - Required: Minimum 3-5 seed nodes
   - Impact: Network can't function without these
   - Cost: $15-30/month minimum (can use free VPS initially)
