# JER Cryptocurrency - Phase 5 Tools

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: These tools are for Phase 5 (Mainnet Launch) ONLY**

Do NOT use these tools during Phase 1-4 (Testing/Testnet). Current easy difficulty is correct for development and testing.

## Genesis Block Miner

### mine_genesis.py

Mines the genesis block with proper difficulty for production mainnet launch.

**When to use:** Phase 5 (9-12 months from now), before mainnet launch

**Current status:** Phase 1 - Development/Testing with easy difficulty ‚úÖ

### Requirements

```bash
# Python 3.7+
python3 --version

# No external dependencies needed (uses standard library)
```

### Usage

**For Mainnet (Phase 5):**
```bash
python3 mine_genesis.py --network mainnet --difficulty 0x1d00ffff
```

**For Testnet (Phase 5):**
```bash
python3 mine_genesis.py --network testnet --difficulty 0x1d00ffff
```

**Custom difficulty:**
```bash
python3 mine_genesis.py --network mainnet --difficulty 0x1c00ffff
```

**Use all CPU cores (default):**
```bash
python3 mine_genesis.py --network mainnet
```

**Use specific number of cores:**
```bash
python3 mine_genesis.py --network mainnet --processes 8
```

### Expected Mining Time

**With 0x1d00ffff difficulty (Bitcoin's start):**
- M1/M2 Mac (8 cores): 2-48 hours (average: 12 hours)
- Intel Mac (4 cores): 4-96 hours (average: 24 hours)
- Cloud GPU (NVIDIA V100): 1-6 hours (average: 2 hours)

**Note:** Time varies significantly due to randomness of mining. You might get lucky and find it in 30 minutes, or unlucky and take 3 days.

### What It Does

1. Sets up genesis block parameters (timestamp, difficulty, message)
2. Parallelizes mining across all CPU cores
3. Tries different nonce values until valid hash found
4. Displays progress (hashrate, time elapsed)
5. Outputs the found nonce and hash
6. Tells you what to update in chainparams.cpp

### Example Output

### After Mining

**Update patches/chainparams.cpp:**

```cpp
// Find the mainnet genesis block section (~line 138-143)
genesis = CreateGenesisBlock(
    1761633768,      // timestamp from miner output
    2083236893,      // nonce from miner output
    0x1d00ffff,      // bits (difficulty)
    1,               // version
    50 * COIN        // reward
);

// Update the expected hash
consensus.hashGenesisBlock = uint256S("0x000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f");
```

**Rebuild:**
```bash
./scripts/build-jer.sh
```

**Test:**
```bash
./scripts/start-mainnet.sh  # (you'll create this script)
bitcoin-cli getblockhash 0
```

### Important Notes

**‚ö†Ô∏è This is a simplified demonstration miner:**
- Actual Phase 5 launch should use Bitcoin Core's CreateGenesisBlock()
- This script needs the correct merkle root from coinbase transaction
- Consider having the actual genesis mining code reviewed in security audit

**‚úÖ Best Practice:**
1. Mine genesis on testnet first (practice)
2. Verify everything works
3. Then mine mainnet genesis
4. Test privately before public launch

### Fair Launch Strategy

**Week 0: Genesis Mining (Private)**
- Use this script to mine genesis
- Keep private until infrastructure ready
- Test thoroughly

**Week 1: Soft Launch**
- Mine first 100-1000 blocks privately
- Set up seed nodes
- Prepare documentation

**Week 2+: Public Launch**
- Announce to community
- Share mining software
- Let others join

See CLAUDE.md for complete Phase 5 launch strategy.

## Troubleshooting

**"Mining is too slow":**
- This is normal with proper difficulty
- Consider using cloud GPU for $10-50
- Or be patient - it will eventually find it

**"No valid hash found after days":**
- Very unlikely but possible (bad luck)
- Let it continue running
- Check that difficulty is set correctly

**"Script shows 'found' but hash doesn't validate":**
- There's a bug in the merkle root calculation
- For actual Phase 5, use Bitcoin Core's CreateGenesisBlock()
- This script is for learning/demonstration

**"Want to stop and resume later":**
- Mining is stateless - can't resume
- Each run starts from nonce 0
- Use cloud GPU to finish faster
